 * findLocalMaxima(image, taken, peaks, threshold, radius, image_size_x, image_size_y, margin, peak_size)

 * Finds the locations of all the local maxima in an image with
 * intensity greater than threshold. Adds them to the list if
 * that location has not already been used.
 *
 * image - the image to analyze, assumed square.
 * taken - spots in the image where peaks have already been
 * peaks - pre-allocated storage for peak data.
 * threshold - minumum peak intensity.
 * radius - circle in which the peak is maximal.
 * image_size_x - size of the image in x (fast axis).
 * image_size_y - size of the image in y (slow axis).
 * margin - number of pixels around the edge to ignore.
 * peak_size - size of the peaks array.
 *
 * Returns the number of peaks found.
 *
 *
 * FIXME: This would probably be faster if we also marked locations
 *        that are less than the current search location and did
 *        not bother to search them as well.
